# Linear-optimization
Find the optimal solution in a given linear system by simplex method,without using any numeric python library

## The System should have following conditions
*  the objective is minimization
*  variables are non-negative
*  constraints are less than or equal to type with non-negative right-hand sides 
*  simplex algorithm converges to a solution.

## Input Format
The first number in .txt files gives the number of constraints 𝑚 and second number gives the number of variables 𝑛. Then, there is a 1 × 𝑛 matrix which gives the cost vector 𝑐. Finally, there is an 𝑚 × (𝑛 + 1) matrix which represents the augmented matrix [𝐴|𝑏].
